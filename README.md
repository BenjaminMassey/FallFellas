# Fall Fellas

Extremely simple (just HTML) website that I'm using to keep track of me and my friends'
win counts in the video game "Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout". This will be pointed to
by www.fallfellas.com. The win counts and entries in general will be done manually.
This was created since Fall Guys does not keep track of your wins for you, and while
this website will still be manual, at least it will be kept track of.
